## Update 1
### Wednesday, 14 July 2021

#### **Key Development Items**

* JSON file updated with list of all games to be included in application.
* Defined packages to import and key functions.
* Implemented user input function to capture number of players.

#### **Issues Encountered**

* Function caused an infinite loop due to indent error.

#### **Development Roadblocks**

* Working to resolve output data (final game recommendations) to make it cleaner, clearer and easier for users to read.
* Work out how to set a filtered set of options to be displayed to the user, when other options need to be excluded (i.e. if no "short" games in the "RPG" genre exist, do not display "RPG" as a selectable option).

#### **Miscellaneous Notes**

* Functions for user input use the following:
    * `while` loop; 
    * `if/else`; and
    * `try/except` blocks for error handling
* Defined variables within functions to ensure code was "dry", especially for repeated error messages.
