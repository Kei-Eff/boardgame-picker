## Purpose and Scope

This application is designed to give users suggestions for tabletop games to play, and features options for users to choose between single-player, two-player, and more than two player (party) games.

The last 18 months (as of development, July 2021) has seen more and more people take an interest in indoor activities out of necessity. And as a form of leisure away from TV screens, computer monitors, phones and tablets; board games, card games and other tabletop games have seen a massive boost in popularity.

The influence of video games over the last few decades has also bled into tabletop game development and the sheer variety of game types and genres now available makes it hard to dive into the hobby sometimes.

Even those well versed in tabletop games are sometimes so spoilt for choice that analysis-paralysis sets in when trying to decide on a game to play.

This application aims to ease that issue. The current list of games available is curated from a personal selection of popular titles, but there is scope to expand on this list in the future.

Users of this app are either individuals looking for a game to spend their leisure time on (the single player option); or the "host" of a game night introducing another player (or players) to a game that the other parties may be interested in playing. Ideally, the host will have experience with most of the titles offered (or tabletop game conventions in general) as this helps in smoother set up of the titles, and serves a more accurate representation of the average game duration.
